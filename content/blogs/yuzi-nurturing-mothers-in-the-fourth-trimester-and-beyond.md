Pregnancy is a miraculous journey, but ask any new mother, and she'll tell you that the real challenge begins after the baby arrives. The so-called "Fourth Trimester" is a period of intense change and adjustment that often goes unnoticed and unsupported. This is where Yuzi, a platform founded to provide comprehensive care and support to mothers during this transformative time, comes in.

The inspiration behind Yuzi stems from the recognition that pregnancy, as demanding as it is, pales in comparison to the difficulties faced during the postpartum period. Statistics like **1 in 7 women experiencing postpartum depression**, nearly **1/3 of women dealing with pelvic floor disorders**, and **60% experiencing diastasis recti** highlight the urgency of addressing the unique challenges of the Fourth Trimester. However, it's not just these maladies that go undiagnosed and untreated, but also matresence â€“ the profound physical, hormonal, and emotional changes associated with motherhood.

#### Why is the fourth trimester so hard?

##### Heart

The fourth trimester introduces a rollercoaster of hormonal fluctuations, arguably the steepest and most sudden changes most people will ever experience. These hormonal shifts impact sleep, cognitive function, thyroid health, and even sexual well-being. Yuzi offers behavioral health concierge support and a nurturing community of moms who understand these struggles intimately.

##### Body

In a world where women are often expected back to work within weeks of childbirth, Yuzi emphasizes the importance of recovery. It's worth noting that after open-heart surgery, a 90-day recovery period is recommended. Yuzi provides nutritional support, rest, and recovery, including massages and herbal baths, ensuring that mothers are physically prepared for the demands of motherhood.

##### Mind

The knowledge gap that many new mothers face is another challenge. Yuzi empowers mothers with information about lactation, pelvic floor health, and meditation techniques to support their mental and emotional well-being.

#### The Origins of Yuzi Care

The concept of Yuzi is rooted in common sense, drawn from the ancient Chinese practice of *Yuezi*, or "Sitting the Moon Cycle." It recognizes that mothers need holistic nourishment encompassing the physical, mental, and emotional aspects of their well-being.

##### A Personal Journey

Our founder's own journey into motherhood was a profound catalyst for Yuzi's creation. In 2019, after a military deployment and settling into a career in Big Tech, she received the joyous news of her first pregnancy. However, the reality of the Fourth Trimester hit hard. Their baby was born prematurely, necessitating a week in the NICU. The exhausting back-and-forth between the hospital and home, the need to ensure bonding time, and the challenges of pumping and feeding became a relentless cycle. It was during this period that she recognized the immense need for comprehensive support for new mothers.

**Yuzi is more than just a service; it's a lifeline for mothers** navigating the profound changes of the Fourth Trimester. It is a testament to the power of empathy and understanding in helping mothers flourish during this critical phase of motherhood. In the words of our founding team: "Yuzi - It just makes sense."
