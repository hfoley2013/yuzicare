I'm Stephiney Foley, the Founder and Chief Mom at Yuzi. Thank you for stopping by! Many wonder why I started Yuzi and why I'm so dedicated to maternal wellness.

Before my first child, I never expected to face postpartum depression.I was one of millions of mothers silently enduring the storm of postpartum depression, sleep deprivation, anxiety, and loneliness. Studies show that up to 85% of women experience some type of mood disturbance after giving birth and 67% of parents with young children feel isolated. I spoke with many other mothers about their postpartum journey. They struggled, often alone, with breastfeeding, pelvic floor dysfunction, night sweats, nutrition, lower back pain, you name it.  My pain was universal and a collective cry for help, for healing, for support, and for connection.

I knew that I had to do something, not just for my own sake, but for every mother out there working through her own unique maternal journey. I want to redefine the maternal care experience in America and create the lifeline that mothers so desperately need and deserve.

Yuzi's mission is to “build the world's largest maternal care platform, change how society supports mothers and families, erase silent suffering, and foster connection.”

Our Yuzi Retreat is just the beginning. Our ultimate goal is to serve every mother, every family craving connection, and every care provider longing to make a difference.

For us, Yuzi is more than a company; it's a calling. Join us in the Yuzi Revolution!

Warmly,
