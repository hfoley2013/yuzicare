Hi, My name is Stephiney Foley. I am the founder and Chief Mom of Yuzi. Thank you for visiting us! A lot of people ask me why I started Yuzi and why I am so passionate about maternal wellness.

Before having my first child, I never thought I would have to deal with postpartum depression… And yet, as I cradled my baby, my heart was heavy with an indescribable ache. Postpartum depression had taken hold of me. The world had seemingly moved on, celebrating the miracle of life, and I was drowning. With the help of my friends and family, I eventually pushed through to the other side and the realization hit me like a freight train, I was not alone in this struggle!

I was one of millions of mothers silently enduring the storm of postpartum depression, sleep deprivation, anxiety, and loneliness. In fact, recent studies estimate that up to 85% of women experience some type of mood disturbance after giving birth and two-thirds (66%!) parents with young children feel isolated. I spoke with many other mothers about their postpartum journey. They struggled, often alone, with breastfeeding, pelvic floor dysfunction, night sweats, nutrition, lower back pain, you name it.  My pain was not unique; it was part of a collective cry for help, for healing, for support, and for connection. With that, the seed for Yuzi was planted.

I knew that I had to do something, not just for my own sake, but for every mother out there working through her own unique maternal journey. I want to redefine the maternal care experience in America and create the lifeline that mothers so desperately need and <u>deserve</u>.

Yuzi's mission became clear: to build the world's largest maternal care platform; a revolution that would change how society cares for mothers and their families. We want to turn the tide on silent suffering by making it easy for moms to find support and connection.

We are starting with the Yuzi Retreat— a holistic experience during which mothers can rest and heal after delivery, connect with other parents, and get support from postnatal experts all in one place.

This is just the beginning. Our ultimate goal is to serve every mother who feels the weight of the world on her shoulders, every family that yearns for connection, and every care provider who longs to make a difference. For our team, Yuzi is more than just a company, it’s a calling.

Please, join us on our mission to revolutionize maternal wellness.

Warmly,
