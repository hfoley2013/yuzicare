Yuzi is a haven designed specifically for moms during one of the most challenging periods of their lives—the postnatal journey. Our retreat offers a nurturing and supportive environment where mothers can recover,  rejuvenate, and connect with their babies and each other as they navigate the joys and demands of early motherhood.

#### The Essence of Zuo Yue Zi

At Yuzi, we’ve drawn inspiration from the time-honored tradition of Zuo Yue Zi, or "Sitting the Month" and have woven in modern luxuries and technology for a seamless and comprehensive experience. Our retreat is the first of its kind in the Pacific Northwest, a pioneering endeavor to bring the wide-ranging benefits of this practice across the globe and into our contemporary culture.

#### Embracing the Journey of Motherhood

Our team, consisting of experienced parents and experts in postnatal care, is passionately committed to supporting both your recovery and baby bonding. We strive to empower you with knowledge, tools, and resources that will assist you on your journey of motherhood, helping you navigate challenges, celebrate milestones, and embrace the incredible role you play in your child's life. We offer a range of carefully curated services and programs tailored to meet the diverse needs of first-time and experienced moms alike.

#### A Sanctuary for Healing and Empowerment

At Yuzi, we understand the unique physical, emotional, and mental needs that arise after childbirth. We believe that every mom deserves dedicated care and support during this transformative phase. Our luxurious accommodations provide a comfortable and tranquil setting to bond and recharge.


We invite you to embrace the transformative power of Zuo Yue Zi, while honoring your individual choices and preferences. Whether you seek peaceful respite, support and education from our team, connection with other moms or all of the above, our community is here to support you every step of the way.
