- title: What exactly is Yuzi postnatal retreat?
  answer: The Yuzi retreat provides holistic postpartum care to promote physical recovery and emotional wellbeing. Each stay booked with Yuzi includes luxury hotel accommodations, a 24-hour nursery, nutritious meals and snacks, onsite experts in postpartum care, infant care education, and social programming. Our experience combines modern luxury amenities with the ancient wisdom of "Yuezi" and is tailored to the needs of each guest.
  
- title: Who is Yuzi suitable for?
  answer: Yuzi is designed to cater to the needs of first-time and experienced mothers alike within the first six weeks postpartum.

- title: Can my family stay with me?
  answer: Partners are welcome to join you during your stay at the Yuzi retreat.  While we value the importance of broader family bonding the primary focus of the Yuzi Retreat is postpartum recovery and parent & baby bonding. We have daily visiting hours for families to share in this special time while also respecting the need for mothers to rest, heal, and bond with their babies.

  answer: Please fill out our waitlist form to secure your place.  We are accepting reservations for May 1st 2024 or later. We require a $100 deposit to hold your reservation. Your reservation is fully refundable at any time.

- title: When should I engage Yuzi?
  answer: We’re happy to connect with you at any time, but we recommend new parents to begin thinking about their postpartum plan at the beginning of their second trimester, or around month four of pregnancy.  This provides optimal time for our team to work with you to understand your needs, answer your questions, and tailor your Yuzi Retreat experience.
  
- title: What can I expect during my stay at Yuzi?
  answer:  Everyone’s postpartum journey can look a little different. As such, the Yuzi Retreat is not a one size fits all experience. You are welcome to take part in daily programming focused on postpartum wellness, infant care, and connecting with other parents. On-site specialists are here to support your recovery and help you learn or refresh on newborn care in a one-on-one setting. We would be happy to assist in coordinating spa appointments during your stay. Nutritious meals are provided and you’ll have access to our private mother’s lounge for snacks and socializing.

- title: I'd love to stay with Yuzi, but it's out of my budget. What can I do?
  answer:  We believe every mother deserves high quality postpartum care. We are committed to making our services more accessible and are exploring several avenues, such as insurance reimbursement, employer partnerships, and a sponsor a mom program to reduce individual financial expenditure.  Please stay tuned as we launch additional features.
